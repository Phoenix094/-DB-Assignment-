Q1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a relationship defined by the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. This "category_id" column is an integer and it refers to the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This indicates that a product is associated with one product category, while a product category can have multiple products associated with it. This is a common way to organize products in an e-commerce system or an inventory management system.

Q2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you could implement a foreign key constraint between the "category_id" column in the "Product" table and the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. This would ensure that any value stored in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must exist as a primary key in the "Product_Category" table.
Additionally, you could implement a trigger on the "Product" table to check if the "category_id" column is not null and if the value exists in the "Product_Category" table before inserting or updating a record. If the value is not valid, the trigger could raise an error or return a message indicating that the category is not valid.
